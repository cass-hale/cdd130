    <p>Hello world, I'm Cassidy Hale. I'm a Computer Sciences major and I'm hoping to be in a programming job of some sort, I'm not exactly sure yet. I love music, I can play guitar, bass guitar, ukulele, a little piano, clarinet, and I sing but not well. I also love photography. It's a recent hobby of mine but so fun, I really love it.</p>
    <p>I am not married nor am I planning on it for a while. I don't really have a career, I'm hoping this degree path will get me to where I will want to go. I'm after my Bachelor's degree at the moment, this is my very first semester at college. I chose this particular degree because the career opportunities are abundant and it's seeming as though they will be for a very long time. I want to be able to be useful in the career path I choose. I also chose it because it's good stuff to know, I've always wanted to be able to code and create my own websites and such. </p>
    <p>I have been a member my entire life, I was raised in the church and happy about it. My favorite quote is by President Thomas S. Monson, and it goes "Never let a problem to be solved become more important than a person to be loved". I use that as a motto of sorts in my life. I never want someone to go unloved because of something going on they or I can't control. A favorite scripture of mine, I have lots, but one that has stood out to me recently is Doctrine and Covenants 93:37 which says "Light and truth forsake that evil one".</p>
